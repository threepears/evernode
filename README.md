### Goal

Create a note-taking application in MVC format that lets us add a new note, edit current notes, see a list of notes, and assign categories to those notes.

### Tools Used

Node, Express, Jade, MongoDB, Mongoose, Nodemon, Code editor

### Installation

Create new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/evernode.git

Run the following two commands in your Terminal (in seperate tabs) to start the Nodemon server and the Mongo server:
